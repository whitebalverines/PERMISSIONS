### PERMISSIONS ###

### GENERAL ###

- Please let me know if you would like to make a translation for any of my mods, just to make sure that there isn't already someone working on it
- Please ask before making portraits/sprites for my NPCs. Generally I'll agree, but I'd still like to know what's going on!

- You may not use my assets in projects that will be locked behind a paywall or cost downloaders money to use

### NPCS ###
